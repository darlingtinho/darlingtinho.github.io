    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>minoHealth is a multifaceted system developed with
the objective of democratising Quality Healthcare with innovative and cutting edge
technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cloud computing and Biotechnology in
Africa. minoHealth and its AI Research lab, <a href="https://ai.minohealth.com" target="_blank">minoHealth AI Labs</a> researches and experiments
with Artificial Intelligence and ways it can be applied to Healthcare to make it faster, better
and yet, cheaper.</p><br><br>
    <h3>minoHealth: The multifaceted system</h3>
<p>minoHealth is a multifaceted system that combines Artificial Intelligence, Big Data/Data Analytics and Cloud Computing in order to optimise processes involved in Healthcare and also make them affordable and scalable
compared to the current practices especially in Africa. minoHealth uses Artificial
Intelligence to make Health Predictions/Forecasts, Diagnoses and Prognoses and organises and stores Patient Health Records in the cloud with
‘Hospital portal’ and ‘Central Portal’ for authorised healthcare personnels. All Data
collected is intelligently organised with ‘Big Data’ approaches and technologies, they are
continually analysed so important health information/stats on health center patients are
visualised and made available to physicians.</p><br>

<p>At the same time, with the permission of the various health centers, all the health data are
also automatically saved and organised within the ‘Central Portal’ which allows for National
Health Records Databases. This could also be extended even for the continent. Analysed
and visualized health information/stats is a really good source of studying and noting early
patterns of outbreaks nationally or continentally, so they can be managed beforeescalation.
Collected data is used to further train and develop more Artificial Intelligence Healthcare models and systems.</p><br><br>

       <h3>Our Founder</h3>
       <p>Darlington Ahiale Akogo is the Founder, C.E.O and Director of Artificial
    Intelligence at minoHealth. He's also an Advisory Board Member and Ambassador
    at <a href="http://aiexpoafrica.com" target="_blank">AI Expo Africa</a>, the largest business focused AI community in Africa. Darlington Ahiale Akogo also heads
    minoHealth AI Labs where they research and apply Artificial
    Intelligence to fields like Biotechnology, Neuroscience, Optometry,
    Epidemiology, Dietetics/Nutrition and Agriculture. And with Gudra AI
    Studio, they explore Artificial Intelligence applied to general domains
    like Energy, Art, Education and Linguistics.<br><br> 
    Darlington Ahiale Akogo is also an Artificial Intelligence advocate, communicator and mentor. He
    believes Artificial Intelligence can solve a lot of problems plaguing Africa and being proactive is
    necessary in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and the 4th Industrial Revolution. So Darlington
    advocates, teaches and communicates Artificial Intelligence through seminars, lectures, interviews,
    writings and mentorships. He was a research presenter at NeurIPS 2018, the largest Conference on
    Artificial Intelligence in the World. And he was one of the speakers at the ​AI Expo Africa 2018 in
    Cape Town, South Africa and Next Einstein Forum’s ​<a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2018/september-11th/maiden-africa-science-week-ghana-celebration-set-for-sept-25.php" target="_blank">Africa Science Week</a>​. He was also a participant in
    Massachusett Institute of Technology(MIT)'s Global Community <a href="https://www.biosummit.org/darlington-akogo-2018/" target="_blank">​BioSummit</a> 2018. His research paper
    ‘ScaffoldNet: Detecting and Classifying Biomedical Polymer-Based Scaffolds via a Convolutional
    Neural Network’ has been accepted by the ​<a href="http://saiconference.com/FICC" target="_blank">Future of Information and Communications Conference​</a>,
    which is sponsored by IEEE. Alongside great minds including Yoshua Bengio, who's celebrated as one
    of the Fathers of Deep Learning, Darlington is featured in and wrote for the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H42MYMV" target="_blank">"​Artificial
    Intelligence Simplified​</a>: 99 Use Cases And Expert Thoughts For Starters" which was put together by
    Data Science Nigeria. He also wrote reports and essays for ​<a href="https://issuu.com/aimediasynapse/docs/synapse_-_issue_1-opt" target="_blank">Synapse Magazine</a> - ‘The Voice of African
    Artificial Intelligence & Data Science’ by AI Media.</p>
